# S.O.S Diary

Team FIAR back-end repo

### THE PROBLEM 
As School of Code bootcampers, we all know that finding additional information can be difficult sometimes with so many sources available. Finding information from previous weeks is very challenging as it is all placed in slack channels with no proper seperation of different weeks. 

### THE GOAL
We wanted to create a resource diary in which is easier to find content, with no need for endless scrolling.

### THE TECH-STACK
We created a Full-Stack application using React, JSX, CSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and testing coverage using Cypress, Jest and Supertest.
